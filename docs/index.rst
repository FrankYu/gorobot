   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to m1ch3l's documentation!
==================================

m1ch3l, also know as gorobot, is an IRC robot with the following
features:

* support of multiple servers
* support of multiple channels
* support of private conversations
* flood control to be able to print pokemons in ASCII art without
  being G-lined
* administration commands via a dedicated set IRC channels (admin channels)
* JSON configuration
* external scripts that can be invoked via IRC (!commands)
* support of Docker

The official m1ch3l lurks in the shadows of freenode, but there are
probably some others hanging around in the wild, we don't know how
many.
